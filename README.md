# Web version of Focas app
Making doing work and slacking off public: Now for computers!

The Focas app on iPhone makes a status post based on your phone position. When it is faced down, when you are studying, it will make a status post that you are doing work. When you turn it back up, it will make a status post that you are slacking.

This repository adapts this idea into a web application form using Rails. You will get a facebook status update everytime you leave the web page.

**NOTE: The app will not work because the app has not been reviewed by Facebook (and I have no plans to), hence, Facebook API calls will not work.**
