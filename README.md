# Web version of Focas app

## Installation


Making doing work and slacking off public now for computers

The Focas app on iPhone makes a status post based on your phone position. When it is faced down, when you are studying, it will make a status post that you are doing work. When you turn it back up, it will make a status post that you are slacking.

This repository adapts this idea into a web application form using Rails. You will get a facebook status update everytime you leave the web page.
